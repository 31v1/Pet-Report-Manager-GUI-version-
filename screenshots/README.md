This folder contains screenshots of the **Pet Report Manager (GUI version)** project in different stages of development.

They are intended to provide a visual reference of the application's interface, even when the project cannot be executed immediately (e.g., due to OS changes or environment setup).

## Purpose

- Show the evolution and current state of the graphical interface.
- Document layout decisions and user interaction flow.
- Support the project documentation with real visuals.

## Notes

Some screenshots may reflect the application running on **Linux Mint** after migration from Windows.  
Minor visual inconsistencies (such as font rendering or component alignment) are expected and are part of the ongoing adaptation process.

All images are for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.
